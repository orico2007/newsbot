## 2026-11-05 - 52-week-high momentum continuation (web idea)
Source: https://quantpedia.com/strategies/52-weeks-high-effect-in-stocks , https://www.r-bloggers.com/2017/05/trading-strategy-52-weeks-high-effect-in-stocks/ (George & Hwang 52-week-high effect; published as monthly cross-sectional, so this is an unverified daily-bar translation).
Rules: long when close > highest close of prior 252 days (variant: within 2%), close > SMA50 > SMA200, SPY > 200d, ATR/price < 6%, 10-day cooldown per symbol, enter at close (+0.05% slip), fixed hold N days, stop k ATR, no other exit. Rank by 63-day return. Same portfolio simulator as the champion (10% x 12 pos, 4/day). Script: lab_52wh.py. 7 variants tried (multiple-comparison discount applies; no year selection was needed since nothing passed).

| Variant | Trades | Win % | PF | Ret % | Max DD % | L12 n / PF | PF 2021/22/23/24/25/26 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CHAMPION | 749 | 66.0 | 1.40 | 36.8 | 6.2 | 171 / 1.50 | 1.82/0.14/1.39/1.57/1.24/1.45 |
| new high, hold 10, stop 4 | 1042 | 51.2 | 1.14 | 33.3 | 19.8 | 247 / 1.19 | 1.11/0.49/1.12/1.32/1.42/1.03 |
| new high, hold 20 | 623 | 48.6 | 1.18 | 35.8 | 16.6 | 141 / 1.48 | 0.89/0.65/1.25/1.38/1.07/1.43 |
| new high, hold 5 | 1485 | 50.0 | 0.99 | -3.8 | 20.1 | 351 / 0.83 | - |
| new high + vol>1.5x avg, hold 10 | 628 | 54.1 | 1.31 | 53.1 | 14.9 | 148 / 1.08 | 1.83/0.57/1.04/1.77/1.55/1.03 |
| within 2% of high, hold 10 | 1202 | 51.8 | 1.16 | 47.7 | 15.2 | 270 / 1.14 | 1.35/0.87/0.85/1.30/1.42/1.09 |
| new high, hold 10, stop 6 | 1026 | 50.8 | 1.14 | 32.5 | 21.8 | 243 / 1.25 | - |
| new high, exit close<MA10 (hold 20) | 1889 | 49.4 | 0.93 | -9.7 | 12.2 | 428 / 0.89 | - |
| Champion + (vol>1.5x, hold 10) combined | 1175 | 59.6 | 1.34 | 87.5 | 14.0 | 273 / 1.26 | 1.72/0.37/1.26/1.59/1.58/1.16 |

Verdict: NOT a promotion candidate. Breakout continuation is far weaker than mean reversion on win rate (50-54% vs 66%), drawdown 15-20% vs 6%, and fails 2022 and the last 12 months. The volume-confirmed version (PF 1.31) is the only one of interest; it fades in 2023, 2026 and L12 (PF 1.03-1.08), and the combined portfolio's higher return comes with 2x the drawdown (the combined sim shares the same 12 slots, so it is not a clean diversification test). Not added to challenger.py. Possible follow-up: test volume-confirmed breakout only as a separate sleeve with its own slots, and correlation of monthly returns with the champion.

## 2026-11-05 (run 2) - turn-of-month calendar filter on champion entries (web idea)
Source: https://quantpedia.com/strategies/turn-of-the-month-in-equity-indexes , https://quantpedia.com/an-examination-of-the-turn-of-the-month-effect/ (published on index returns, not on mean-reversion entries; unverified translation).
Rules: take the champion's own trade list (A+E+F, SPY>200d, hold 7, stop 4 ATR) and keep only entries by calendar position (trading-day index from month start / to month end), then re-run the same portfolio simulator (10% x 12, 4/day). Script: lab_tom.py. 5 variants (multiple-comparison discount applies; no year selection needed since nothing passed).

| Variant | Trades | Win % | PF | Ret % | Max DD % | L12 n / PF | PF 2021/22/23/24/25/26 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CHAMPION | 749 | 66.0 | 1.40 | 36.8 | 6.2 | 171 / 1.50 | 1.82/.14/1.39/1.57/1.24/1.45 |
| TOM window (last 2 + first 3 days) | 193 | 62.2 | 1.60 | 13.6 | 4.8 | 49 / 1.45 | 2.75/.06/.85/3.32/1.82/1.38 |
| NOT TOM window | 600 | 67.2 | 1.39 | 27.4 | 7.7 | 129 / 1.63 | 1.77/.24/1.54/1.30/1.15/1.59 |
| first half of month | 374 | 65.0 | 1.42 | 18.6 | 4.0 | 86 / 1.49 | 2.46/.15/1.28/1.22/2.28/1.42 |
| second half of month | 408 | 67.4 | 1.41 | 18.3 | 4.6 | 93 / 1.58 | 1.52/.13/1.29/1.99/1.05/1.54 |
| last 5 + first 5 days | 373 | 64.6 | 1.31 | 14.8 | 8.1 | 93 / 1.25 | 2.42/.09/1.88/1.59/.86/1.18 |

Verdict: NOT a promotion candidate. TOM entries show a higher PF (1.60) but on only 193 trades, lower win rate, 2023 PF 0.85, and L12 PF below the champion; the year pattern is erratic (2.75 / 3.32 vs 0.85), i.e. noise. Non-TOM entries are as good as the champion, so no calendar filter helps; it only removes trades and return. Not added to challenger.py. Possible follow-up: SPY-dip (3d < -1%) as a priority ranking rather than a hard filter; NR7/inside-day sleeve with its own slots.

## 2026-11-05 (run 3) - stock-selection ranking of same-day champion signals (own idea)
Source: none (own idea; follow-up from the fear-filter round). Rules: take the champion's trade list (A+E+F, SPY>200d, hold 7, stop 4 ATR) and change only WHICH signals fill the 4 daily slots by re-ranking on one feature (63d return minus SPY, ATR%, 20d dollar volume, RSI2, IBS, 3d return), either replacing the rule score or only breaking ties inside a rule tier. Same simulator (10% x 12, 4/day). Script: lab_rank.py. 8 features x 2 modes = 16 variants (heavy multiple-comparison discount).

| Variant (pure rank) | Trades | Win % | PF | Ret % | Max DD % | L12 PF | PF 2021/22/23/24/25/26 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CHAMPION | 749 | 66.0 | 1.40 | 36.8 | 6.2 | 1.50 | 1.82/.14/1.39/1.57/1.24/1.45 |
| high RS63 vs SPY first | 747 | 66.3 | 1.46 | 43.1 | 6.5 | 1.60 | 1.99/.15/1.22/1.74/1.37/1.47 |
| LOW RS63 first (opposite) | 753 | 66.9 | 1.44 | 42.6 | 6.5 | 1.43 | 1.59/.16/1.39/1.90/1.31/1.37 |
| low ATR% first | 751 | 66.6 | 1.42 | 38.7 | 6.5 | 1.51 | 1.68/.14/1.38/1.70/1.27/1.46 |
| high ATR% first (opposite) | 749 | 65.8 | 1.42 | 40.9 | 6.5 | 1.51 | 1.81/.17/1.20/1.75/1.37/1.37 |
| high dollar volume | 749 | 66.0 | 1.43 | 40.8 | 6.8 | 1.57 | 1.82/.15/1.27/1.79/1.22/1.47 |
| lowest RSI2 | 746 | 66.6 | 1.41 | 38.8 | 6.5 | 1.49 | 1.64/.17/1.31/1.73/1.35/1.37 |
| lowest IBS | 747 | 66.4 | 1.44 | 42.0 | 6.5 | 1.54 | 1.84/.15/1.26/1.79/1.33/1.43 |
| worst 3d return | 744 | 65.7 | 1.44 | 41.7 | 6.5 | 1.58 | 2.00/.17/1.20/1.73/1.32/1.44 |
Tie-break-within-rule-tier versions: PF 1.40-1.42, return 37-39%, i.e. identical to champion.

Verdict: NOT a promotion candidate; selection ranking is not a source of edge. Opposite rankings (high RS vs low RS, high vs low ATR%) both give PF ~1.42-1.46 vs 1.40, so the small gains are reshuffling noise, not signal. Best-looking (high RS) has lower 2023 PF (1.22) and a higher drawdown than champion. The edge sits in the entry rules and regime gate, not in which of the same-day candidates gets chosen. Not added to challenger.py. Possible follow-up (web run next): NR7/inside-day contraction sleeve with its own slots; multi-day-low (N-day low) reversion variants; pairs/relative value.

## 2026-11-05 (run 4) - Connors cumulative RSI(2), N-day-low and NR7 reversion sleeves (web idea)
Source: https://www.prorealcode.com/prorealtime-trading-strategies/rsi-2-strategy-larry-connors/ , https://www.mql5.com/en/articles/17636 (Connors RSI(2)/cumulative RSI; marketed backtests, unverified; daily-bar translation on the cached universe).
Rules: long, close > SMA200, SPY>200d gate, ATR/price < 6%, 3-day cooldown, enter at close, stop 4 ATR, hold 7. Triggers: crsi35 = RSI2(t)+RSI2(t-1) < 35; crsi10 = sum < 10; low10 = 10-day closing low and close 3% below MA5; low5down = 3 down closes + 6-day low + RSI2<20; NR7 = narrowest range of 7 days, close down, IBS<0.3. Same simulator (10% x 12, 4/day), standalone sleeve and combined with champion (shared slots). Script: lab_crsi.py. 6 variants (multiple-comparison discount; nothing passed so no year selection).

Verdict: NOT a promotion candidate. Best variant (crsi<10 with prior-high exit) is essentially a re-skin of the champion's RSI2 rules: PF 1.35 vs 1.40, lower on 4 of 5 non-2022 years vs champion, and the combined portfolio has higher return (47.6%) but lower PF (1.32) and 8.6% drawdown, i.e. same signals, no real diversification (2022 still fails ~0.14-0.29). Looser triggers (crsi<35, 3-down-days) add trades and drawdown 13-14% with L12 PF ~1.0. NR7 contraction has no edge on the long side (PF 0.98). Conclusion: the short-term reversion edge is already captured by A+E+F; more oversold-variant triggers only add correlated trades. Not added to challenger.py. Follow-ups: sector-relative reversion (buy the weakest stock within a strong sector), overnight-vs-intraday split, gap-fade sleeve.

## 2026-11-05 (run 5) - gap-down fade ("gap down then recover") and overnight-hold sleeves (own idea, gap-fade/overnight topics from the seed list)
Source: none (own idea; follow-up listed in runs 3-4). Rules: long, close > SMA200, SPY>200d gate, ATR/price < 6%, 3-day cooldown, enter at close (+0.05% slip), stop 4 ATR, exit on close > prior high, max hold 7. Trigger "gap-recover": open < prior close by X% and close > open. Overnight variants: buy close, sell next open. Same simulator (10% x 12, 4/day), standalone and combined with champion (shared slots). Script: lab_gap.py. 9 variants tried (multiple-comparison discount; no year selection, all thresholds reported).

| RSI2<10 & IBS<.15 overnight only | 1566 | 51.4 | 1.03 | 1.5 | 6.7 | 387 / 1.16 | - |

Verdict: NOT a promotion candidate, but the most interesting complement so far. A stock that gaps down 2%+ and then closes above its open (intraday buyers absorbed the gap) is a different entry condition from RSI2/IBS "close near the low": win rate 69-72%, PF 1.3-1.4 across thresholds -1/-2/-3% (neighbours agree, so not a single lucky threshold), L12 PF 1.23-1.67, and 2022 PF 0.58 at the -1% threshold (better than the champion's 0.14). The combined portfolio (champion + gap<-2%) keeps PF 1.40, raises return 36.8 -> 85.7% and L12 PF 1.50 -> 1.53, but max drawdown rises 6.2 -> 9.7%, Sharpe is flat (1.02 vs 1.05) and 2023 PF falls to 1.08 (sleeve alone 0.89-0.94 in 2023 at every threshold). It does not beat the champion on PF or on all-but-one year, and the extra return is mostly more capital deployed in shared slots. Overnight-only holds have no edge (PF 1.03-1.05): the reversion profit accrues over the multi-day hold, not the first night. Not added to challenger.py. Follow-ups: gap-recover with 2023-style regime check (why does it fail 2023?), a gap sleeve with its own non-shared slots/position sizing, and sector-relative reversion.

## 2026-11-05 (run 6) - volume-conditioned short-term reversal filter on champion entries (web idea)
Source: https://ideas.repec.org/a/bla/jfinan/v61y2006i5p2365-2394.html (Avramov, Chordia, Goyal 2006, liquidity and autocorrelations), https://users.nber.org/~confer/2004/mmsu04/goyal.pdf (search hits only; I did not fetch the papers, so the exact claims are unverified). Literature hypothesis: low-volume declines reverse more than high-volume ones. Daily-bar translation on the cached universe.
Rules: take the champion's own trades (A+E+F, SPY>200d, hold 7, stop 4 ATR) and keep only those whose signal-day volume / 20d avg volume (or 3-day avg volume ratio) falls in a band; re-run the same simulator (10% x 12, 4/day). Script: lab_vol.py. 7 variants (multiple-comparison discount). Filtered lists are fewer trades, so total return falls mechanically.

| Variant | Trades | Win % | PF | Ret % | Max DD % | L12 n / PF | PF 2021/22/23/24/25/26 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CHAMPION | 749 | 66.0 | 1.40 | 36.8 | 6.2 | 171 / 1.50 | 1.82/.14/1.39/1.57/1.24/1.45 |

| vol ratio < 1.0 | 399 | 67.7 | 1.28 | 12.2 | 4.7 | 106 / 1.61 | 1.14/.16/1.13/1.54/.92/1.71 |
| vol ratio >= 1.0 | 477 | 64.4 | 1.50 | 29.2 | 4.8 | 95 / 1.70 | 1.73/.13/1.24/1.96/1.54/1.50 |

Verdict: NOT a promotion candidate; the published low-volume effect does NOT show up (low-volume entries PF 1.20-1.28, worse than champion). Heavier volume is mildly better (>=1.0x: PF 1.50, Sharpe 1.28, lower drawdown) but with 36% fewer trades, lower return (29.2 vs 36.8%), and 2023 PF 1.24 < champion 1.39, so it fails the beat-on-return and year tests. Notable: heavy-volume days (selling capitulation) pair with run 5's gap-recover finding; a volume-ranked tie-break was effectively covered in run 3 (dollar volume = noise). Not added to challenger.py. Follow-ups: sector-relative reversion, gap sleeve with own slots, pairs.
